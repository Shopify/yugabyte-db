# Goals

YugaByteDB is a unified database purpose-built to power modern, distributed cloud services. It was built with the following design goals:
- **highly scalable**
- **highly resilient**
- **very performant**
- **cloud-native**

In order to support the needs of a wide array of distributed cloud services without imposing the necessity to learn a new API, YugaByte can be accessed using one or more of the following APIs on top of a common data fabric underneath:
- **Redis** APIs
- **Cassandra** Query Language (CQL)
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL - in progress)
